The module ShiftNMFk is contained within the ShiftNMFkMD.jl file in src.
It uses the rest of the file in src to export several functions used to perform the entire ShiftNMFk procedure and find the locations of the sources. 

Two examples are provided. Both feature a grid of 16 detectors and 3 sources. In one example the sources are inside the grid while in the other they are outside. These examples are the same found in our ShiftNMFk paper.
